The game's objective is to follow and repeat a random sequence of button presses generated by the device.

Here's how the typical gameplay works:

The game starts with a single button.
The player must then press the lit button.
After the player successfully presses the correct button, the game adds another button to the sequence, and the player must repeat the entire sequence in the correct order.
The game continues to add buttons to the sequence with each successful round, challenging the player's memory.
The Simon game continues until the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or failing to repeat the sequence accurately. The game then either ends or restarts, depending on the version.

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code provided earlier implements a simplified version of the Simon game for the web, allowing users to play the game in their browsers. It includes buttons with different colors and the logic to generate and check sequences. Players can start the game, follow the sequence, and try to achieve higher levels by successfully repeating longer sequences.
